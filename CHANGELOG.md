# Release Notes

## 1.22.0 (unreleased)

### What's new
- Support for Statamic 3.1 white labeling.
- Seperate compilation of Tailwind CSS so when you use and edit just `resources/css/site.css` to add custom CSS, compilation will be way faster.

### What's improved
- Disable `max-width` on `prose` class by default (as it's already in a container).

## 1.21.1 (2020-02-17)

### What's new
- Use `inverted="true"` on `resources/views/components/_buttons.antlers.html` or `resources/views/component/_button.antlers.html` to use inverted styled buttons. Usefull on contrasting backgrounds (BYOS: bring your own styling).
- Added GitHub to the Social Media blueprint. Thanks [Gal](https://github.com/morpheus7CS).

## 1.21.0 (2020-02-12)

### What's new
- Added an optional dark mode toggle. Follow the instructions in README or `resources/views/components/_dark_mode_toggle.antlers.html` on how to enable (class based) Dark Mode.
- Search disabled and removed from partials by default to clean the templates up a little. Follow the instructions in README or `resources/views/components/_search_form.antlers.html` on how to enable search.

## 1.20.5 (2020-02-11)

### What's new
- Add commented `IMAGE_MANIPULATION_DRIVER=imagick` to `.env.example` to make it easier to enable Imagick.

### What's improved
- Disable darkmode by default. That shaves of some dev build size and will make your debugger faster. Woof!

## 1.20.4 (2021-02-10)

### What's new
- Use Mailhog as the default SMTP config in `.env.example` since it's a local service and free, unlike Mailtrap, the Laravel default. Run `brew install mailhog`, `valet proxy mailhog http://127.0.0.1:8025` and catch your mails on `https://mailhog.test`.

### What's improved
- Published the password reset blade views and removed rad mode to be in line with the login view. This method will likely improve siginificantly with the upcoming release of Statamic 3.1 containing white-labeling features. 

## 1.20.3 (2021-02-09)

### What's improved
- Make DynamicToken check work with both non www and www domains. Thanks [Frederik](https://github.com/freshface).

## 1.20.1 (2021-02-08)

### What's new
- The ability to override different favicons with custom assets.

## 1.20.0 (2021-02-07)

### What's new
- Redirects old URL's to new URL's and present it in a fancy grid. That's it. Only kicks in when a 404 is triggered. Just like the SEO global it's only accessible to the superusers and the `marketeer` role (which you add to users with the `editor` role). 

## 1.19.3 (2021-02-06)

### What's fixed
- Specify asset container for image fields.

## 1.19.1 (2021-02-05)

## 1.18.15 (2021-01-27)

### What's new

- Don't e-mail form fields that have `consent` as a handle: those are usually single checkbox field that have to be checked for the form to be valid.
- Yield a SEO title to `resources/views/snippets/_seo.antlers.html` from `resources/views/error/404.antlers.html` to render a page title on the error page. This pattern is reusable to optional other error pages.

- Update deploy scripts in `README.example.md`.
- Add `route:cache` command to optional schedule in `app/Console/Kernel.php`.

## 1.18.9 (2021-01-19)
